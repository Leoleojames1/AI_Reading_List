## [Tool Use, Unified](https://huggingface.co/blog/unified-tool-use)

There is now a unified tool use API across several popular families of models. This API means the same code is portable - few or no model-specific changes are needed to use tools in chats with Mistral, Cohere, NousResearch or Llama models. In addition, Transformers now includes helper functionality to make tool calling even easier, as well as complete documentation and examples for the entire tool use process. Support for even more models will be added in the near future.
